## Antiderivatives

$\int f'(x)$ # incomplete

## Integration rules

| Power Rule |
|---|
| For $f(x) = x^n$ <br> $$\int x^n~dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}+C$$ <br> Exception: $\int \frac{1}{x}~dx = \ln |x|+C$ |

| Constant Multiple Rule |
|---|
| $$\int an^x~dx = a \int x^n~dx$$ |

| Sum and Difference Rule |
|---|
| $$\int [ u(x) + v(x) + w(x) ] = \int u(x) + \int v(x) + \int w(x)$$ |
