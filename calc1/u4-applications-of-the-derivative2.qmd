## Indeterminate Forms and $\text{L'H\^{o}pital's}$ Rule

Indeterminate forms:

- $\frac{0}{0}$
- $\frac{\pm \infty}{\pm \infty}$

To find the limits of functions that give an indeterminate form, we can use $\text{L'H\^{o}pital's}$ rule:

$\text{L'H\^{o}pital's}$ Rule

Suppose
$$
\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{0}{0}
$$
or
$$
\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{\pm \infty}{\pm \infty}
$$

Where \( a \) can be any real number, infinity or negative infinity. In these cases we have,

$$
\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}
$$

*Note: Sometimes you need to apply L'Hôpital's Rule more than once.*

## Optimizing equations

In real world situations, we may want to find the maximum or the minimum of a function. The process of finding the best situation is called **optimization**.

##### Optimasation Problem Steps

1. Draw a sketch of the shape
2. Write down the formulas we can use to construct the shape
  - For the variable being optimized
  - For the variable with a constraint

::: {.callout-caution}
Make sure the main equation is a function of only one variable
:::

3. Find the maxima or the minima as per req

4. Conclusion

::: {.callout-note}
Always: Answer the question asked with the critical number and the optimized value

## Related Rates

We can take the derivative of an equation with respect to anything usingimplicit differentiation.

This is always differentiation wrt time

Although an equation may not have time in it, we can find its derivative wrt time using the chain rule.

for $f(x)$:

$$\frac{d~[f(x)]}{dt} = \frac{df(x)}{dx} \cdot \frac{dx}{dt}, \text{ (Chain Rule)}$$

$$\frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{1}{ \dfrac{d~[f(x)]}{dx} } \cdot \frac{d~[f(x)]}{dt}$$

Just as the two variables $f(x)$ and $x$ have a relationship, the two rates depend on each other and are called **Related Rates**.

When we take the derivative with respect to an unrelated variable, it is important to use  Leibnitz notation, $\frac{dy}{dx} to communicate what the rate is.

<details><summary>Leibniz notation</summary>

In calculus, Leibniz's notation, named in honor of the 17th-century German philosopher and mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, uses the symbols $dx$ and $dy$ to represent infinitely small (or infinitesimal) increments of $x$ and $y$, respectively, just as $\Delta x$ and $\Delta y$ represent finite increments of $x$ and $y$, respectively.

### Procedure for solving related rate problems

1. Draw the shape, its variables and its related rates

2. Find the FWG to formulate and understand the question (it's not necessary to write this down):
    - Find:
    - When:
    - Given:

::: {.callout-caution}
The rates may be positive (increasing, growing, etc) or negative (decreasing shrinking, etc).
:::

3. Substite the given values into the equation of the variable to be found

::: {.callout-caution}
When you label your diagram, it may have width and length and height or radius, but that doesn’t mean all of them are variables

Read your question carefully and be sure to think about which dimensions are actually changing and which ones are constant.

Constants can be substituted into the equation before taking the derivatve.

4. Write the conclusion

## Differentials

This is simply writing: $\frac{dy}{dx} = f'(x)$, in the form:

$$dy = f'(x)~dx$$

This $dy$ is the differential
