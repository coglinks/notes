# Zener Diode

A  Zener diode  is a silicon    _pn_    _ _   junction device\.

Designed for operation in the reverse region  \. 

The breakdown voltage of a Zener diode is set by carefully controlling the doping level during manufacture\.

Recall diode reaches reverse breakdown\, its voltage remains almost constant even though the current changes drastically\, and this is the key to Zener diode operation\.

 __Breakdown Characteristics__ 

Zeners are commercially available with breakdown voltages from less than 1V to more than 250 V with specified tolerances from 1% to 20%\.

When reverse voltage \( _V_ R\) is increased\, the reverse current \( _I_ R\) remains extremely small up to the “knee” of the curve\.

Reverse current is also called the Zener current\,    _I_   Z  \.

 __Voltage Regulation:__ 

Zener Equivalent circuit:

Zener diode can be used as a type of voltage regulator for providing stable reference     voltages \.

Not efficient though\!

Limited to applications that require only low current to the load\.

 __Example 1: \(Solution\)__ 

First\, calculate the voltage drop across RL assuming the diode is open circuit as shown in Fig\. 116\.

As V=  Vz  ; the   zener   diode will be in “ON” state\.
