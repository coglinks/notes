# Bipolar Junction Transistor ( BJT)

![](l4.1-bipolar-junction-transistor-img/l41-bipolar-junction-transistor_4.png)

The  __BJT __ is constructed with three doped semiconductor regions separated by two  _pn_  _ _ junctions\, as shown in the epitaxial planar structure opposite\.

The three regions are called:

 __        \- __    __ Emitter__ 

 __        \-  Base__ 

 __        \-  Collector__

substrate is a physical supporting material for the transistor

For a BJT to operate properly as an amplifier\, the two  _pn_  _ _ junctions must be correctly biased with   __external dc voltages\.__ 

In this course\, we   will   use the    _npn_    _ _   transistor for illustration\. 

Operation of the  _pnp_  _ _ is the same as for the  _npn_  _ _ except that the roles of the electrons and holes\, the bias voltage polarities\, and the current directions are all reversed\.

 _Forward Biased _    _npn_    _ Transistor as Amplifier_ 

![](l4.1-bipolar-junction-transistor-img/l41-bipolar-junction-transistor_13.png)

 _Note: In Both cases\, BE is Forward biased and BC terminals is Reverse Biased_

BJT Transistor Currents:

![](l4.1-bipolar-junction-transistor-img/l41-bipolar-junction-transistor_14.png)

T  he arrow on the emitter inside the transistor symbols points in the direction of conventional current \.

Diagrams show that the emitter current \( _I_ E\) is the sum of the collector current \( _I_ C\) and the base current \( _I_ B\)\, expressed as follows

![](l4.1-bipolar-junction-transistor-img/l41-bipolar-junction-transistor_15.png)

![](l4.1-bipolar-junction-transistor-img/l41-bipolar-junction-transistor_16.png)

 _I_   B   is very small compared to    _I_   E   or    _I_   C

The  collector current is compromised of two currents:

Note: capital\-letter subscripts indicate dc values

![](l4.1-bipolar-junction-transistor-img/l41-bipolar-junction-transistor_18.png)

 __DC Beta \(__   β  dc      __\) and __    __A__    __C Beta \(__   β  a  c      __\) __ 

β  dc  represents the  __current gain__  OR  __amplification factor __ of a transistor\.

β  dc  is sometimes referred to as  _h_  _fe_

![](l4.1-bipolar-junction-transistor-img/l41-bipolar-junction-transistor_19.png)

![](l4.1-bipolar-junction-transistor-img/l41-bipolar-junction-transistor_20.png)

![](l4.1-bipolar-junction-transistor-img/l41-bipolar-junction-transistor_21.png)

β  dc     range from less than 20 to 200 or higher

![](l4.1-bipolar-junction-transistor-img/l41-bipolar-junction-transistor_22.png)

 __DC Alpha \(__   α   __dc__    __\) and AC Alpha \(__   α   __aa__    __\)__ 

The ratio of the collector current \( _I_ C\) to the emitter current \( _I_ E\) is  __alpha__ \(α dc\) and  __alpha__ \(α ac\) \.

The alpha is a less\-used parameter than beta in transistor circuits\.

![](l4.1-bipolar-junction-transistor-img/l41-bipolar-junction-transistor_23.png)

Ideally::    α=1

In reality: α is between 0\.9 and 0\.998
