# OP-AMP as Comparator

A comparator circuit is used to compare two input signals\, and indicates at the output which input has the larger signal\.

A comparator circuit accepts input of linear voltages and provides a digital output that indicates when one input is less than or greater than the second\.

A basic comparator circuit can be represented as

![](l6.3-operational-amplifier-img/l63-operational-amplifier_2.png)

If the  __non\-inverting input__  is higher than the inverting input\, the output of the amplifier will saturate at the  __positive__  supply voltage\.

If the  __inverting input__  is higher than the non\-inverting input\, the output of the amplifier will saturate at the  __negative__  supply voltage\.

Here the reference voltage is connected to the inverting input\.

The output will switch to its positive saturation level when the input  _V_  _i_  _ _ goes more positive than the \+6V reference voltage level\.

The output  _V_  _o_  _ _ drives the LED on as an indication that the input is more positive than the reference level\.

What is the reference voltage for each comparator in the following figure?

In digital circuitry the signals are at either one of the two levels\, representing the binary values of 1 or 0\.

An analog–digital converter \(ADC\) obtains a digital value representing an input analog voltage\.

A digital–analog converter \(DAC\) changes a digital value back into an analog voltage\.

# Digital-to-Analog Conversion

__D/A conversion __ is an important interface process for converting digital signals to analog \(linear\) signals\.

One method of D/A conversion uses a  <span style="color:#0000ff">scaling adder </span> with input resistor values that represent the binary weights of the digital input code\.

A more common method for D/A conversion is known as the  <span style="color:#0000ff">R\-2R ladder </span> method\.

Following figure shows a four\-digit digital\-to\-analog converter \(DAC\)\.

The switch symbols represent transistor switches for applying each of the four binary digits to the inputs\.

The lowest\-value resistor R corresponds to the highest weighted binary input \(23\)\. All of the other resistors are multiples of R and correspond to the binary weights 22\, 21\, and 20\.

Determine the output voltage of the DAC in following figure for digital inputs:

Assume a binary 1 is represented by 5V and binary 0 is represented by 0V\.

<span style="color:#ff0000">Note that </span>  <span style="color:#ff0000"> _D_ </span>  <span style="color:#ff0000">0</span>  <span style="color:#ff0000"> is the least significant binary digit and most significant digit is </span>  <span style="color:#ff0000"> _D_ </span>  <span style="color:#ff0000">3</span>  <span style="color:#ff0000">\.</span>

::: {.notes}

Each successive binary code increases the output voltage by So, for this particular straight binary sequence on the inputs, the output is a stairstep waveform
going from 0 V to in steps, as shown in Figure. If the steps are very small, the output approximates a straight line (linear).

R/2R ladder is more commonly used for D/A conversion than the scaling adder and is shown in the following figure\.

It requires only two resistor values\. The network of resistors is called a  <span style="color:#0000ff"> _ladder network_ </span>  _\. _

The output voltage is proportional to the binary weight of the input bits\.

Reference voltage Vref is the voltage used to represent binary state of “1”\.

R/2R ladder DAC\.

::: {.notes}

A ladder network accepts inputs of binary values at, typically, 0 V or Vref and provides an output voltage proportional to the binary input value.

Determine the output voltage of the DAC in following figure for digital inputs 0110 _2_ \. Consider Vref equal to 16 V\.

<span style="color:#3366ff">Solution:</span>

Therefore\, 0110 _2  _ digital converts to 6 V analog\.

# Analog-to-Digital Conversion

![](l6.3-operational-amplifier-img/l63-operational-amplifier_14.png)

__A/D conversion __ is an interfacing process often used when a linear  __analog __ system must provide inputs to a  __digital __ system\.

<span style="color:#0000ff"> _F_ </span>  <span style="color:#0000ff"> _lash _ </span> method of A/D conversion uses parallel comparators to compare the linear input signal with various reference voltages developed by a voltage divider\.

When the input voltage exceeds the reference voltage for a given comparator\, a high level is produced on that comparator’s output\.

2n \- 1 comparators are required for conversion to an n\-digit binary number\.

<span style="color:#0000ff">Priority encoder is a digital device that produces a binary number on its output representing the highest value at its input\.</span>

3\-bit analog\-to\-digital converter using op\-amps as comparators\.

2\-bit Analogue to Digital Converter \(ADC\) circuit is shown in the figure\.

This will give us a 2\-bit output code for all four possible values of analogue input\.
