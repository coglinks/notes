# Bipolar Junction Transistor ( BJT)

Biasing of a transistor:

If an amplifier is not biased with correct dc voltages on the input and output\, it can go into  saturation or   cutoff   when an input signal is applied\.

Linear operation: larger output has same shape as input except that it is inverted

Nonlinear operation: output voltage limited \(clipped\) by   cutoff

The region along the load line including all points between saturation and   cutoff   is known as the linear region of the transistor’s operation \.

Note: If the transistor is operated in this region\, the output voltage is   __ideally__   a linear reproduction of the input\.
