# Network Layer CharacteristicsThe Network Layer

![](t7-network-layer-img/t7-network-layer-v6_0.png)



* Provides services to allow end devices to exchange data\.
* IP version 4 \(IPv4\) and IP version 6 \(IPv6\) are the principle network layer communication protocols\.
* The network layer performs four basic operations:
  * Addressing end devices
  * Encapsulation
  * Routing
  * De\-encapsulation

# Network Layer CharacteristicsIP Encapsulation

![](t7-network-layer-img/t7-network-layer-v6_1.png)

IP encapsulates the transport layer segment\.

IP packet will be examined by all layer 3 devices as it traverses the network\.

The IP addressing does not change from source to destination\.

# Network Layer CharacteristicsConnectionless

_IP is Connectionless \- There is no connection with the destination established before sending data packets\._

Connectionless communication is conceptually  similar to sending a letter  to someone without notifying the recipient in advance\.

IP requires no initial exchange of control information to establish an end\-to\-end connection before packets are forwarded\.

# Network Layer CharacteristicsBest Effort

_IP is Best Effort \- IP is inherently unreliable because packet delivery is not guaranteed\._

![](t7-network-layer-img/t7-network-layer-v6_4.png)



* With no pre\-established end\-to\-end connection\, senders are unaware whether destination devices:
  * Are present and functional when sending packets\,
  * Receives the packet
  * Are able to access and read the packet\.
* The IP protocol was not designed to track and manage the flow of packets\. These functions\, if required\, are performed by other protocols at other layers\, primarily TCP at Layer 4\.

# Network Layer CharacteristicsMedia Independent



* _IP is media Independent: Operation is independent of the medium \(i\.e\.\, copper\, fiber\-optic\, or wireless\) carrying the data\._


![](t7-network-layer-img/t7-network-layer-v6_5.png)



  * IP does not concern itself with the type of frame required at the data link layer or the media type at the physical layer\.
  * As shown in the figure\, IP packets can be sent over any media type: copper\, fiber\, or wireless\.

# IPv4 PacketIPv4 Packet Header

Diagram is read from left to right\, 4 bytes per line

_The two most commonly referenced fields are the source and destination IP addresses_ \.

These fields identify where the packet is coming from and where it is going\.

Typically\,  _these addresses do not change while travelling from the source to the destination\._

Significant fields in the IPv4 header:

| :-: | :-: |
| __Version__ | This will be for v4\, as opposed to v6\, a 4 bit field= 0100 |
| __Differentiated Services__ | Used for   QoS : DiffServ – DS field or the older IntServ – ToS or Type of Service |
| __Header Checksum__ | Detect corruption in the IPv4 header |
| __Time to Live \(TTL\)__ | Layer 3 hop count\. When it becomes zero the router   will discard the packet\. |
| __Protocol__ | I\.D\.s next level protocol: ICMP\, TCP\, UDP\, etc\. |
|  __Source IPv4 Address__  | 32 bit source address |

# IPv6 PacketsLimitations of IPv4



* IPv4 address depletion  – We have basically run out of IPv4 addressing\.
* Lack of end\-to\-end connectivity  – To make IPv4 survive this long\, private addressing and NAT were created\. This ended direct communications with public addressing\.
* Increased network complexity  – NAT was meant as temporary solution and creates issues on the network as a side effect of manipulating the network headers addressing\.  NAT causes latency and troubleshooting issues \.

# IPv6 PacketsIPv6 Overview

![](t7-network-layer-img/t7-network-layer-v6_7.png)



* Developed to overcomes the limitations of IPv4\.
* IPv6 improvements:
  * Increased address space  – based on 128 bit address\, not 32 bits
  * Improved packet handling  – simplified header with fewer fields
  * Eliminates the need for NAT  – since there is a huge amount of addressing\, there is no need to use private addressing internally and be mapped to a shared public address

# How a Host RoutesHost Forwarding Decision



* Each host device creates its own routing table\.
* A host can send packets to the following destinations:
  * Itself –  127\.0\.0\.1  \(IPv4\) – the special address of the  loopback interface
  * Local Hosts – on the same LAN
  * Remote Hosts – on the different LANs
* The source device determines whether the destination is local or remote by comparing its own IP address with the destination IP address\.
* Remote traffic is forwarded directly to the    _default gateway _   on the LAN\.

# How a Host RoutesDefault Gateway



* A router or layer 3 switch can be a default\-gateway\.
* Features of a default gateway \(DGW\) :
  * It must have an IP address in the same range as the rest of the LAN\.
  * It can accept data from the LAN and forward traffic to other networks\.
* If a device has no default gateway or a bad default gateway\, its traffic will not be able to leave the LAN\.

__Local Network__

The host will know the default gateway either statically or through DHCP in IPv4\.

All devices on the LAN use the DGW to send traffic remotely\.

__R1 Routing Table__

![](t7-network-layer-img/t7-network-layer-v6_15.png)

 _Packet arrives on the Gigabit Ethernet 0/0/0 interface of router R1\. R1 de\-encapsulates the Layer 2 Ethernet header and trailer\._ 

 _Router R1 examines the destination IPv4 address of the packet and searches for the best match in its IPv4 routing table\. The route entry indicates that this packet is to be forwarded to router R2\._ 

 _Router R1 encapsulates the packet into a _   _new Ethernet header and trailer_   _\, and forwards the packet to the next hop router R2\._

# Introduction to RoutingIP Router Routing Table



* There three  types of routes  in a routing table:
* __Directly Connected networks __ –  Are automatically added by the router\, provided the interface is active and has IP addressing\.
* __Remote networks__  – Routes that the router does not have a direct connection and may be  learned:
  * Manually –   with a static route
  * Dynamically  –  by using a dynamic routing protocol
* __Default Route __ –  a gateway of last resort \, used when there is not a match in the routing table

# Introduction to RoutingStatic Routing

![](t7-network-layer-img/t7-network-layer-v6_17.png)

Static Route Characteristics:

Must be  configured manually

Must be  adjusted manually  by the administrator  when there is a change in the topology

Good for small non\-redundant networks

Often used in conjunction with a dynamic routing protocol for configuring a default route

R1 is configured with a static route to reach the 10\.1\.1\.0l24 network\.  If this path changes\, R1 will require a new static route\.

![](t7-network-layer-img/t7-network-layer-v6_18.png)

If the route from R1 via R2 is no longer available\, a new static route via R3 would need to be configured\.

# Introduction to RoutingDynamic Routing

![](t7-network-layer-img/t7-network-layer-v6_19.png)

Dynamic Routes Automatically:

Discover remote networks

Maintain up\-to\-date information

Choose the best path to the destination

Find new best paths when there is a topology change

R1 is using the OSPF routing protocol to let R2 know about the 192\.168\.10\.0/24 network\.

R2 is using the OSPF routing protocol to let R1 know about the 10\.1\.1\.0/24 network\.

![](t7-network-layer-img/t7-network-layer-v6_20.png)

R1\, R2\, and R3 are using the OSPF dynamic routing protocol\.  

If there is network topology change\, they can automatically adjust to find a new path\.

* Types of routes:

# Configure the Default GatewayDefault Gateway on a Host

![](t7-network-layer-img/t7-network-layer-v6_24.png)

The default gateway is used when a host sends a packet to a device on another network\.

The default gateway address is generally the router interface address attached to the local network of the host\.

To reach PC3\, PC1 addresses a packet with the IPv4 address of PC3\, but forwards the packet to its default gateway\, the G0/0/0 interface of R1\.

Network address of LAN1

 __Note__   : The IP address of the host and the router interface must be in the same network\.
