## 2.1The Particular Solution

So, what is the value of the constant, C?

We know already that when finding the antiderivative of a given function we have to include a constant of integration.This is because a single function can have a family of antiderivatives.

Consider some function, $f(x)$

$$\int f(x)dx=F(x)+C$$

 If we know something about its antiderivative $F(x)$ we can solve for the constant, C.

![](./images/fG6uNDbe7znFQ3pgX73HyWQSqpAt42A9k.png)

This is usually a point on a curve called an initial value.

This process gives us a particular solution.

The graphs above all have the same derivative, $3x^2$ and we are given an initial value of $F(1)=3$ What is the particular solution?

## FINDING THE PARTICULAR SOLUTION GIVEN AN INITIAL VALUE

1. Perform the integration to find the anti-derivative. 2.Use the given information (initial value) to solve for C. 3. Replace C in your indefinite integral and state the Particular Solution

E1Find the particular solution $f(x)$ given that $f^{\prime}(x)=x^{3}-x+1$ and the function passes through (2, 6).

## 2.2 Applications of Integration: Electrical Applications

## TOTAL CHARGE

Recall that current $i$ is the rate of change of charge $q$ :

$$i=\frac{dq}{dt}\quad\Rightarrow\quad q=\int $$

![](./images/fGB1yOyWonduMprcvdS8ZWtaSYaV2x3Rc.png)

What are the units for charge?.

### VOLTAGE ACROSS A CAPACITOR

Voltage $V$ across a capacitor with capacitance $C$ is:

\begin{align*}
V&=\frac{q}{C}\quad\Rightarrow\quad V=\\&=\frac{1}{C}\cdot q \\
\end{align*}

What are the units for voltage?

E1 The current in a certain electric circuit is given by: $i(t)=e^{\frac{-t}{10}}$ , Initial Conditions: $q(0)=0$

a) Find an expression for the total charge, $q(t)$ ,that passes a point in the circuit.

![](./images/fb3gs6SGpXGP46s3Bpyl9h62r27lhIVkn.png)

b）Use your expression to determine the amount of charge that passes the point in 2 seconds.

E2The initial voltage across a 5F capacitors zero.

 a) What is the expression for voltage across the capacitor if $i=\frac{2t}{t^2+1}$

![](./images/f9vx4bnEhiDTFPqGX4us9ne1MhQhu6ddX.png)

b)What is the voltage after 4 s?

### CURRENT THROUGH AN INDUCTOR

Current $i$ through an inductor with inductance $L$ is:

\begin{align*}&V=L\frac{di}{dt}\\&\frac{di}{dt}=\frac{1}{L}\cdot V\end{align*}\quad\Rightarrow\quad i=

![](./images/fo9uCZBfor8yedDlwR8kDzp2gUOsLVkxH.png)

What are the units of current?.

E3 A circuit has a 0.5 Henry inductor and has a voltage given by $V(t)=2t\sin(t^{2})$ The current through the inductor at $t=\sqrt{\pi}$ seconds is 4 Amps.

What is the expression for the current through the inductor?

# 2.3 MATH1030 Review: Area Under the Curve and The Definite Integra

In MATH1030 we used the rectangle method to approximate the area under $f(x)$ and between $x=a$ and $x=b$

![](./images/fP26pDxOanVGykePvKLnBhkX4PgdfoMrP.png)

![](./images/fI9GatxUSN3a0crHrQUvwgQfUO555YaxX.png)

![](./images/fnB3zSGzl3gMaXd5Xx9sLiYt8y0OvguP9.png)

We can get an exact area of $f(x)$ by having an infinite number of rectangles.

![](./images/fCC7P1o5AObC6tLLfOSa09m4Uk1VgUf8c.png)

We call this exact area beneath a curve and above the axis-the Definite Integral

### THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF CALCULUS

If a function $f(x)$ is continuous on the closed interval $[a,b]$ and $F(x)$ is an anti-derivative of $f(x)$ on the interval then:.

$$\int\limits_{a}^{b}f(x)dx=F(x)\Big|_{a}^{b}=F(b)-F(a)\:\text{is the Definite Integral},$$
with $a$ and $b$ as lower and upper bounds

The area under a curve between two points is found by calculating the definite integral between the two points. The area under the curve means the area bounded by the curve, the axis, and the boundary points.

So, the area under $f(x)=x^{2}+1$ and between $x=0$ and $x=4$ can be found using the definite integral

$$\int\limits_0^4\Bigl(x^2+1\Bigr)dx$$

![](./images/ffcsiK74thxYS0qRI3YWokWEkWfKazhUq.png)

EXACTAREA UNDER A CURVE

The definite integral for a curve from a to b will give the sum of the signed Areas.

Area should be Positive ONLY

 To find Area we must be careful to use the HEIGHT from the Representative Rectangle.

Find the area under the curve $f(x)=x$ between $x=-4$ and $x=4$ .

![](./images/fgqocirPmRSHpgYZvxZ4fShrrmpKYxi99.png)

For all Area problems, it is important to understand the representative rectangles.

Representative RECTANGLE: is the same rectangle we used for approximation

The height of the rectangle helps us determine what our definite integral should be Instead of $\Delta x$ or y we will now use dx and dy as we will use the Definite Integral to find areas.

![](./images/flF13zu5pSHXuU17GyqGWcBdHAtIY63oz.png)

 Different areas will require different Representative Rectangles and have different heights

 Some Areas will require more than one Representative Rectangle Draw another rectangle anytime the nature of the area changes **Each rectangle will have a different expression for the height

For each graph of $f(x)$ ：

1.Shade the area. 2. Draw the representative rectangle(s) and label it. 3.Write the definite integral needed to find the area

![](./images/fsG2nSc6GFR8GMi6n0UpB6d9gyYGEzxp3.png)

![](./images/fabW6Gu7sAiaqt8xtbkovIs5W4ZSLR4e8.png)

![](./images/fptbGXslxKg2DEqrxk7mzbkZKBpqqn7tY.png)

![](./images/fg9Bsk3giL3afHGnaioAVc0wgbq2BS4Sl.png)

For functions of Y, area under the curve. is between the curve and they axis:

The rectangle will be horizontal, the bounds are y values and the width of the rectangle is $dy$ .

![](./images/fYkIcOyizdL9Vlktr1hRgeAGbB6wQ1ZgR.png)

$$Area=\int_{0}^{4}f(y)dy$$

## Example:

For each case below,draw representative rectangles and label them dx or dy: Write an expression for the height of the rectangle

![](./images/ftZg2lKD31Gl9uINiTQSAotdoBwZfLZYB.png)

## Solving Area Problems

1: Mark the lower and upper bounds of the on your graph. Shade the area

2: Draw the representative rectangle(s). Find any other required bounds

3:Find the equation for the height for each rectangle, $h(x)$

$$A=\int_a^bh(x)dx$$
 4: Write the Definite Integrals for each rectangle with its bounds..

 5: Evaluate the Definite Integral. Remember: Area has units

## Example:

Find the exact area under the curve $y=-x^{2}+9$ between the lines $x=-3$ and $x=3$

![](./images/f0VrFgvuXRbxLFkxDUCBmRUIxaGlCB1Oc.png)

## Example:

Find theexact shaded area under the curve $y=2x^{5}-4x^{3}+2x$

![](./images/fHgQnIODsl86dEbZKzQIhfuoi1zuadEVB.png)

# 2.5 Area Under f(y)

All of the functions we've seen so far are functions of $x$ .Some problems involve functions of $y$ . The area under the curve is then between the curve and they-axis.

$$x=\sin y$$

$$x=4-y^{2}$$

$$x=y^{3}$$

![](./images/ficiQ5xpVrTWpMIVERGpcILhZA4gGNwqb.png)

![](./images/feyN7LBnPXG8KZ4zXuUwR3NHO6FNvpm6m.png)

![](./images/fmIqims8rq7CZDXyOdX4va6LzZi2SgEub.png)

IMPORTANT: The functions must be written with x as the dependent variable. ie $x=$

For the area between they-axis and this curve $y=x^3$ with bounds $y=-1$ and $y=1$ ， we need to consider:

The equation $y=x^3$

The bounds

The negative and positive regions

![](./images/fpqH2unISZTKBooWrtrGNFHyzezVGLlZc.png)
 rectangle(s)

The representative

The definite integral would be:

In General: The definite integral for area bounded by the -axis is $A=\int_c^dh(y)dy$

E3 Find the area under the curve $y=\sqrt{(-x)}$ from $y=0$ to $y=2$

![](./images/fsEzc6gqgD03sk15Dq3G7fLdwgKEFKE9m.png)

E4 Find the shaded area between the y-axis and the curve $x=y^{5}-7y^{4}+17y^{3}-17y^{2}+6y$

![](./images/fIxfgcW2BANAifiLipw976QvScX7BNTDL.png)

## 2.6The Representative Rectangle for 2 Curves

For all Area problems, it is important to understand the representative rectangles

REPRESENTATIVE RECTANGLE: is the same rectangle we used for approximation

The height of the rectanglehelpsus determine what our definite integral should be

![](./images/fBMQVq8eipZRyEeWMSTK3CEcpVb2Bi4gk.png)

 Instead of $\Delta x$ or y we will now use dx and dy as we will use the Definite Integral to find areas.

### Example:

For each case below, draw representative rectangles and label them dx or dy Write an expression for the height of the rectangle

![](./images/ffVDt4GuUl3RXvyUxBK5MtiOFqSTn0UGv.png)

![](./images/f9nuNYhQgMTUYguNesnT6iZglpwBSDSfs.png)

![](./images/fp382TriWB1qdigGdkcWQw2Q0XqK1oUxN.png)

![](./images/fifAgrcFg3VSauFuC83u2svrK7prpylff.png)

To find the area between curves we need to write the definite integral as a composition of the two curves The representative rectangle helps us determine this.

![](./images/fiP0bggQ9r8ygtI4nSZ9GkN6xLY5E4Fg0.png)

## Finding the Area Between Curves

1:Find the lower and upper bounds of the area and mark them on your graph.

These may be the intersection of the graphs..

2: Draw the representative rectangle(s). Find any other required bounds

3: Find the equation for the height for each rectangle, $h(x)$

$$A=\int_a^bh(x)dx$$
4:Write the Definite Integrals for each rectangle with its bounds.

 5: Evaluate the Definite Integral. Remember: Area has units.

E1 For each of the following graphs:

4. Shade the area between the two curves. 5.Draw the representative rectangle(s) and label it (them). 6.Write the definite integral(s) needed to find the area.

![](./images/f8iTA5l4VVF927BQZdmfKxRpybYvuy1YL.png)

E2 Find the shown enclosed are bounded by the curves $y=x^{4}-2x^{2}+1$ and $y=x^{2}-1$

![](./images/fbX9plOTGfi0IefBQxpxgFpRYMaEcIkhm.png)

E3 Find the area between the curves $y=\sin x$ and $y=\cos x$ from $x=0$ to

![](./images/fdw6m8UaZF8KBeN0N56euUYmBgpdc7vKk.png)

Always use brackets when you are subtracting curves.

$$\int f(x)-g(x)\:dx$$

$$\int(x^2)-(x^3+1)dx$$

$$\int f(x)-g(x)\:dx$$

$$\int x^2-x^3+1\mathrm{dx}$$
nooooo!

When you are given twofunctions you need toknow which equation matches which curve.You could graph thefunctions on a graphic calculator todo this,but you should learn toidentify them bylooking at them.Let's review

## 2.8 Volume of Revolution - Disc Method

A volume of rotation is created by taking an area in the xy axis and rotating it into a 3D object

![](./images/fDITqpB7v1lwbinEdXE7puP8gEbXbDpct.png)

We can approximate the volume by adding up all the volumes of all the disks:

V

V=

![](./images/fpDAHgKvv7lh1Xk72xNBIU3Sv9vpo9Bnp.png)

Just as we did with area, if we want anexact volume we need to consider an infinite number ofdisks

Now, using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

E1 An area iscreated bybounding theregionunder $y=3$ from $x=-3$ to $x=5$ . Find the volume of the cylinder created by rotating this area about the $x$ -axis.

It is always important to note which axis we're rotating about.

![](./images/fg7IFauY6ywgXs1v3dzCTknyhnG1CGFdH.png)

Since this shape is an actual cylinder,we can compare our definite integral volume to the geometrical equation we commonly use:

![](./images/fdhQ8s4Y0GzdcdDPlo5nMKArIek3fvu5o.png)

![](./images/fQiRdBPpsY7uCE3gacm0PviwaaGUqzzhL.png)

To find the volume:

![](./images/fkL6QY0uZaP5FAdGRgHhQ5lDOhViDyF61.png)

### Find the Volume from Any Area

1.Mark the upper and lower bounds for the area to be rotated.

2. Add the rotation to the correct axis. IMPORTANT!E

3. Draw the representative rectangle and determine the radius, $r(x)$

4. The area of the disk is $A_{D\mathrm{is}k}=\pi r^{2}$ . Write the area in terms of $x$ ， $A(x)$ 5. Use $V=\int_a^bA(x)dx$ to find the volume. Don't forget units!

### DISK METHOD-ROTATING ABOUT X-AXIS

$V=\int_a^bA(x)dx$ where $A=\pi r^{2}$ (area of a disc)

![](./images/fOS70FLS2qcmLUQQ45RlUZerNLThygkof.png)

E2Find the volume of thesolid formed by the rotation of $y=2x$ about the $x$ -axis between $x=1$ and $x=4$

![](./images/fr7B0veAR96wWfzrrghG3MFoBm39TA5GI.png)

E3 Find the volume of the solid formed by rotating the area created by $y=e^x$ about the x-axis

![](./images/fBIRGbXaRS8gLx7SOY3RobF8At0zYQK5Z.png)

![](./images/f0WGg7z461syUZtuxywsW9dsTDZIdTDWE.png)

We don't always rotate about the x-axis.Sometimes we are asked to rotate about the y-axis

 In this case we solve the function for $x$ like when we did for areabetween curves.

 Solving for x does not mean we simply switch x and $y$ in the formula.

Find the volume of the solid formed by rotating $y=4-x^{2}$ about the y-axis.

![](./images/f5nUg9sg4KTzo5ppGHtxw4snHQg6bcGzN.png)

> When curve revolves around the y-axis: $x = g(y)$
> When curve revolves around the y-axis: $y = g(x)$

\begin{align*}
  x = h(y) = r \\
  y = 4-x^2 \\
  \implies x = \pm \sqrt{4-y} \\
  V = \int_0^4 \pi [g(y)]^2 dy \\
  = \pi \int_0^4 (\pm \sqrt{4-y})^2 dy \\
  =  \pi \\
\end{align*}

DISK METHOD - ROTATING ABOUT Y-AXIS

$V=\int_c^dA(y)dy$ where $A=\pi r^{2}$ (area o adisc)

![](./images/fdXdxaPvyXRpDHlDvgFlZGgR95A0UkzWZ.png)

Notice the rectangle is perpendicular to the axis of rotation.

![](./images/fvx51e11dSAWm2FEscFsslRkfDpghUD8m.png)

 Since the area for a disk is $A_{Disk}=\pi r^{2}$ , it doesn't matter if the curve is above or below the axis.

### Above the curve

Under the curve

$$r=(f(x)-0)$$

$$A(x)=\pi(f(x))^2$$

\begin{align*}
&r=(0-f(x)) \\
&\text{.} A(x)=\pi(-f(x))^{2}  \\
&&&=\pi(-1)^{2}(f(x))^{2} \\
&&&=\pi(f(x))^{2}
\end{align*}

### 2.9Volume of Revolution - Washer Method

If we have an area between curves to rotate around the axis,we get a hollow 3d shape(ie it has space in the middle).

We use the same ideas as before but the space inside the shape creates a washer shape, so when we have two curves, we call it the Washer Method.

![](./images/fsRIIQUfnLc4OuLGvhIhF0u4Kgs9g4iGB.png)

We already know that $V=\int_a^bA(x)dx.$ So wecan fn thevolmea before

### Find the Volume using Revolution of an Area between Curves

$$A_{Washer}=\pi r_{o}^{2}-\pi r_{i}^{2}$$
For area between curves that makes a washer shape, we use:

1.Markthe upper and lowerboundsfor the area tobe rotated. 2. Add the rotation to the correct axis. IMPORTANT! 3. Draw a representative rectangle and determine the radius and inner radius. 4. Write the area in terms of $x$ ， $A(x)$ . 5. Use $V=\int_a^bA(x)dx$ to find the volume. Don't forget units!

E1 Find the volume of the solid generated by revolving the enclosed area between $y=x$ and $y=x^{2}$ about the $x$ -axis.

![](./images/fgblVeEpxMzo6r73eXrOllAV5Ade8m9my.png)

![](./images/f3WQDZPGhSbkyehd5dWYN6n1cHyiIb1fk.png)

E2 Find the volume of the solid generated byrevolving the enclosed area between $y=x$ and $y=x^2$ about the y-axis.

![](./images/fme8w868y4FAOpzqY8t5898dKAruWyh7f.png)

## 2.10 Volume of Revolution - Shell Method

Previously, we considered volume as a collection of disks.

![](./images/fmFYYUxQH0vLkznniS43CXpToAdRWCbcR.png)

We can take the same area and rotate it around the y-axis This makes a 3d volume that is a collection of thin cylinders or

![](./images/f77s9G5iLtudl4Hh2GgfBuqGZCPeGYfc7.png)

![](./images/fQFgzhsvl5bFDEwbOdBDtKC8KvTGML0EV.png)

Each Ax makes a shell

![](./images/fCS8pUEocFcTdpFM8Ga0Fcu8u1xFOPEuO.png)

![](./images/fe3DyDH59nwpSLuS59CLlGzUThgfvAqCL.png)

The areaweuse tofindvolume is here

If we unroll the shell we can define the area forintegration as

![](./images/fC8U1hhToNPX9hkaeEV5qdCQDsxpLzH2A.png)

$V=$

$$\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}A(x_i)\Delta x$$

Again,ifwe add up aninfinite number of shells, we get

V=

Now, using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

Given a more complex function, we see that the height of each shell depends on f(x)

![](./images/fGDtUunBOshZc1x38HeA8R1UteQ267ggL.png)

### SHELL METHOD-REVOLVING ABOUT Y-AXIS

$V = \int_a^b A(x)dr$ where $A_{shell}=2\pi rh$ (area of thin shell)

r is $X$, and the height depends on $f(x)$

E1 Using the shell method, find the volume of the solid generated by revolving the first-quadrant region bounded by $y=4-x^{2}$ about the y-axis.

![](./images/fUY7G6ZkX4vE5mCvcizX5nof7lK5Cp1sb.png)

E2 Use the shell method tofind the volume of the solid generated by revolving the region boundedby the $x$ -axis, $y=-\sin(x^{2})$ ， $x=0$ and $x=\sqrt{\pi}$ about the y-axis.

## 2.11.1 Introduction

In the Cartesian coordinate system,we plot apoint $(x,y)$ by starting at the origin O and then moving $x$ units horizontally followed by. $y$ units vertically.

![](./images/fLGZUZRG9vclabhtOLNQ9rnGo9lhpBm0I.png)

This is not the onlyway to define apoint in two-dimensional space.Instead ofmoving vertically and horizontally from the origin to get tothe point we could instead go straight out of the origin until we hit the point and then determine the angle thisline makes with the positive $x$ -axis. We could then use the distance of the point from the origin and the amount we needed torotate from the positive $x$ -axis as the coordinates of thepoint.

![](./images/fUkD6LHiq5vaNCxqnXgQedRoDZ7VXhhyw.png)

Coordinates in this form are called polar coordinates.

The polar coordinate system is a two-dimensional coordinate system in which each point P in the plane is determined by the polar coordinates $(r,\theta)$

To define the polar coordinates $(r,\theta)$ ,wefix an originO called the pole,and construct from O an initial ray called thepolar axis.

Then each point P can be located by assigning to ita polar coordinate pair $(r,\theta)$ as shown in figure1below inwhich"r”givesthe directed distance from origin O to P, and“ $\theta^{\prime}$ ' gives the directed angle from the initial ray to the rayOP.

![](./images/fG5w9ru96A98CUgGgmewDFYpG1xWHtlce.png)

We use the convention that $\theta$ is positive when measured anti-clockwise and negative when measured clockwise.

? $r$ is called the radial coordinate of the point P $\theta$ is called the angular coordinate of the point P

### N.B.

A. The pole O (origin) has no specific angular coordinate $\theta$ , but it has radial coordinate $r=0$ Then we assign to O the polar coordinates $(0,\theta)$ for any angle $\theta$

B. The angular coordinate $\theta$ associated to a given point is not unique. Since adding multiple of $2\pi$ to $\theta$ , does not change the location of the point, then the polar coordinates $(r,\theta)$ and $(r,\theta+2n\pi)$ represent the same point for any integer $n$.

For example, all the following polar coordinates $\left(1,\:\frac{5\pi}{4}\right),\left(1,-\frac{3\pi}{4}\right)$ , $\left(1,\:\frac{13\pi}{4}\right)$ represent the same point in the plane.

(all represent the same point in the plane)

E2: $\left ( 2, \:\frac \pi 3\right ) , \left ( 2, - \frac {5\pi }3\right )$and$\left(2,\:\frac{7\pi}{3}\right)$ (all represent the same point in the plane)

C. Since the radial coordinate $r$ is a directed distance, we allow $r$ to be negative with the convention that the points $(r,\theta)$ and $(-r,\theta)$ lie on the same line through the origin O and at the same distance $|r|$ from O.

If $r>0$ , the point lies in the same quadrant as $\theta$ If $r<0$ , the point lies in quadrant opposite to $\theta$ (quadrant in the opposite side of the pole).

The polar coordinates $(r,\theta)$ and $(-r,\theta)$ represent then two diferent points in the plane For example, the points $\left(2,\:\frac{\pi}{6}\right)$and$\left(-2,\:\frac{\pi}{6}\right)$

D.From the convention of part C,we can say that the polar coordinates $(r,\theta)$ and $(-r,\theta+\pi)$ represent the same point.

More generally,

$(r,\theta)=(-r,\theta+(2n+1)\pi)$ for any integer $n$

For example, the polar coordinates $\left(2,\:\frac{\pi}{6}\right),\left(-2,-\frac{5\pi}{6}\right)$and$\left(-2,\:\frac{7\pi}{6}\right)$all represent the same point in the plane.

$$\begin{array}{|c}(r,\theta)=(r,\theta+2n\pi)=(-r,\theta+(2n+1)\pi)\end{array}$$

For example, $\left(5,\:\frac{\pi}{3}\right)=\left(5,-\frac{5\pi}{3}\right)=\left(-5,\:\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)=\left(-5,-\frac{2\pi}{3}\right).$

This means, a point in polar coordinate system has infinite number of pairs of polar coordinates. (Unlike in cartesian coordinate system where there is only one pair of cartesian coordinatesfora point)

In the right triangle, we have:.

$$r^{2}=\:x^{2}+y^{2}$$
(Pythagorean theorem

And,

$$cos\theta=\frac xr\quad\mathrm{and}\quad sin\theta=\frac yr$$

### 2.11.4 Converting from Polar to Cartesian (Rectangular) Coordinates

To convert from Polar Coordinates to Cartesian (or Rectangular) Coordinates, use the formulas

x = rcos0 and $y=rsin\theta$

Ex.1: Find the rectangular coordinates of the point $\begin{pmatrix}-4,\:\frac{2\pi}{3}\end{pmatrix}$

### Solution

\begin{align*}
&x=-4\cos\left({\frac{2\pi}{3}}\right)=-4\left(-{\frac{1}{2}}\right)=2 \\
&y=-4\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right)=-4\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)=-2\sqrt{3}
\end{align*}

So, in Cartesian coordinates this point is $(2,-2\sqrt{3})$

Ex.2:Find therectangular coordinates of each of the following points

b) (-2, 3)

$$d)\left(\sqrt{2},-\frac{5\pi}{4}\right)$$

$$\mathfrak{c})\begin{pmatrix}2,\frac{\pi}{3}\end{pmatrix}$$

### 2.11.5

### Converting from Cartesian (Rectangular) to Polar Coordinates

To convert from Cartesian (or Rectangular) Coordinates to Polar Coordinates, use the formulas

Since $r^{2}=$ $x^{2}+ y^{2}$
$$tan\theta=\frac{y}{x}$$

Then,

$$r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\quad\text{and}\quad\theta=tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)$$

N.B. Be careful when finding $\theta=tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)$ because inverse tangents only eturn value in the range: $-\frac{\pi}{2}<\theta<\frac{\pi}{2}$ (ie in quadrants 1 and 4 onl)

Important: Recallthat there is a second possible angle and that the second angle is given by $\theta+\pi$

![](./images/f22xtYsOh5q9wPLFEv2TZGFcNn9MOZnzx.png)

Ex.1: Convert (-1,-1) into polar coordinates

### Solution

$$r=\sqrt{\left(-1\right)^2+\left(-1\right)^2}=\sqrt{2}$$

$$\theta=\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{-1}{-1}\right)=\tan^{-1}\left(1\right)=\frac{\pi}{4}$$

This is not the correct angle however. This value of $\theta$ is in the first quadrant and the point we've been given is in the third quadrant. As noted above we can get the correct angle by adding $\pi$ onto this. Therefore, the actual angle is,

$$\theta=\frac{\pi}{4}+\pi=\frac{5\pi}{4}$$

So, in polar coordinates the point is $(\sqrt{2},\frac{5\pi}{4})$ . Note as well that we could have used the first $\theta$ that we got by using a negative r. In this case the point could also be written in polar coordinates as $\left(-\sqrt{2},\frac{\pi}{4}\right)$

Ex.2: Find the polar coordinates of each of the following points:

a)(2,2)

b） (1,-1)

c) $\begin{pmatrix}-1,\sqrt{3}\end{pmatrix}$

d) $\begin{pmatrix}1,-\sqrt{3}\end{pmatrix}$

e) $\left(-2,-2\sqrt{3}\right)$

# 2.11.6 Polar Equation:

Apolar equation is of theform $r=f(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ or more generally $f(r,\theta)=0$

The graph of a polar equation in the xy-plane consists of the points $P(x,y)$ for which:

$$x=rcos\theta\quad\mathrm{and}\:y=rsin\theta.$$

Ex.1:Find the polarequation corresponding to each of each of the following

a) $x=1$

b) $y=3x+2$

d) $x^{2}-y^{2}=9$

e) $x^{2}+(y-3)^{2}=9$

### 2.11.7 Area with Polar Coordinates

We are going to look at areas enclosed by polar curves. Note as well that we said "enclosed by' instead of "under" as we typically have in these problems.These problems work a little differently in polar coordinates. Here is a sketch of what the area that we'll be finding in this section looks like.

![](./images/fBmlHhAGqkugfOkLPiEgcaUrNf511lWYi.png)

To understand the area insideof apolarcurve $r=f(\theta)$ ,we start withthe areaof a sliceof pie.If the slice has angle an radius,the t ' a raction $\frac{\theta}{2\pi}$ of the entir ie

So,the area ofthe slice is:

![](./images/fckYKPWpG7ldN88mlrXGewxZ3iCW6QYd9.png)

Now we can compute the area inside of polar curve. $r=f(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ ,between angles $\theta=\alpha$ and $\theta=\beta$ .As with all bulk quantities, we

1.Break the region into N small pieces. 2.Estimate the contribution of each piece. 3.Add up the pieces. 4.Take a limit to get an integral.

![](./images/fvaZgGGcc7w8fYRUqXbEw29dsOzVC2BH1.png)

In our case, the pece ar slies of angle $\Delta\theta=\frac{\beta-\alpha}N$

These aren't exactly pie slices, since the radius isn't constant,but it's a good approximation when $N$ is large and $\Delta\theta$ is small.

The ith slice has area approxcimately: $A_i=\frac{r_i^*}2\Delta\theta$

So, the whole thing has area $A_N$ approximately

$$A_N=\sum_{i=1}^NA_i\approx\sum_{i=1}^N\frac{r_i^*}{2}\Delta\theta $$

Taking the limit as $N\to\infty$ of the above Sum to get the exact area as the definite integral

$$A=\lim\limits_{N\to\infty}A_N=\int\limits_{\alpha}^{\beta}\frac{r^2}{2}d\theta=\frac{1}{2}\int\limits_{\alpha}^{\beta}r^2d\theta $$

Suppose f is continuous and nonnegative on the interval $\alpha\leq\theta\leq\beta$ ，with $0<\beta-\alpha\leq2\pi$ The area of the region enclosed bythe graph of polar curve $r=f(\theta)$ between the radial lines $\theta=\alpha$ and $\theta=\beta$ is given by the formula.

$$A=\frac{1}{2}\int\limits_{\alpha}^{\beta}r^2d\theta $$
