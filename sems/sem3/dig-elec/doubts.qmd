**Ans** Yes

## T2 Boolean Algebra and Logic Gates

1.  What is the purpose of a buffer gate?

**Ans**

2.  What are the logic voltages of a CMOS gate?

## T4.2 Combinational Logic Circuit Analysis And Simplification SOP POS

1.  <div>

    > **SOP**
    >
    > The output function can be written in SOP form by adding all the min-terms when the output is HIGH(1).
    >
    > **POS**
    >
    > The output function can be written in SOP form by adding all the min-terms when the output is HIGH(0).

    </div>

Isn't POS low instead of high?
