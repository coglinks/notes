### Conversion from Decimal to Other Systems

This is mostly useful for binary, not so much for other systems

You can use the same conversion table for both hexadecimal and octal. Just change the number of entries referenced

Conversion from hex to octal or vice versa, requires indirect conversion with decimal numbers in the middle

#### Decimal to Hexadecimal

Convert $( 726 )_{10}$ to hexadecimal

$$\begin{align*}
726/256 = 2.83... \\
2.83... - 2 = .83... \\
.83 \times 16\\
\end{align*}$$

### BCD

You can create the table for this using the usual binary truth table
