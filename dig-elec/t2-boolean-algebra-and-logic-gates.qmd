## Boolean Constructs and Variables

Only 2 values, 1 and 0, are allowed

## Truth Table

- It describes a relationship b/w the input and output of a logical circuit
- The number of entries corresponds to the number of inputs

### Convert Binary to decimal

For a binary number $abcd$, the position starts from the right to the left. Counting begins from 0. So the position of $d$ is 0 and of $a$ is 3. To convert it to a decimal, we multiply each digit by $2^\text{position number}$, as in:

- $d \times 2^0$
- $c \times 2^1$
- $b \times 2^2$
- $a \times 2^3$

## Logic Gates

### AND Gate

The output is 1 only if all the inputs are 1. Otherwise, it's a zero

Expression: $\mathrm{X = A \cdot B}$

### NOT gate (Invertor)

Gives opposite output of input

Expression: $\mathrm{X = NOT(A) \text{ or }\overline{A}}$

### OR Gate

Shortcut: The output is a zero only if the inputs are a 0. Otherwise it's a one

Expression: $\mathrm{X = A+B}$

### NOR Gate

Contraction of Not OR.

Output is 0 if any of the inputs are 1

Expression: $\mathrm{X = \overline{A+B}}$
