    "text": "Hysteresis\nWhen you magnetize something and remove the magnetizing force, the material will resist losing its magnetization and will take longer time to lose it than the time it took to gain it\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Hysteresis curve\n\n\n\nIn Figure 3, the entire curve represented by bcdefb is called the hysteresis curve, from the Greek hysterein, meaning “to lag behind.” The flux density B lagged behind the magnetizing force H during the entire plotting of the curve.\nThe flux density \\(B_R\\), which remains when the magnetizing force is zero, is called the residual flux density. It is this residual flux density that makes it possible to create permanent magnets.\nThree hysteresis loops for the same material for maximum values of H less than the saturation value are shown in Figure 4. In addition, the saturation curve is repeated for comparison purposes.\nIn an effort to assign a particular value of B to each value of H, we compromise by connecting the tips of the hysteresis loops. The resulting curve, shown by the heavy, solid line in Figure 4 and for various materials in Figure 5, is called the normal magnetization curve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Defining the normal magnetization curve\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Normal magnetization curve for three ferromagnetic materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is saturation (ChatGPT explanation)\n\nWhat is saturation (ChatGPT explanation)\n💡 TL;DR:\nSaturation is the point where increasing the magnetizing field \\(H\\) no longer increases the magnetic flux density \\(B\\) much — the material is already “fully magnetized.”\n\n🧲 What Does That Mean?\nIn ferromagnetic materials (like iron), the atoms behave like little magnets. When you apply a magnetic field \\(H\\), more and more of those atomic magnets align with it — this increases the total magnetic flux density \\(B\\).\n\nAt first: a small increase in \\(H\\) causes a large increase in \\(B\\).\nLater: as more atoms are already aligned, it takes more \\(H\\) to align the rest.\nEventually: almost all magnetic domains are aligned → no more room for improvement → you’re at saturation.\n\nAt this point:\n\n\\(B\\) still increases slightly with \\(H\\), but very, very slowly.\nThis small increase is due to the vacuum permeability (not from alignment anymore).\n\n\n📈 On a Graph:\nIf you plot \\(B\\) vs. \\(H\\):\n\nAt first, the curve rises steeply.\nThen it starts to level off.\nThat flat region at the top is the saturation region.\n\n\n🔁 Back to Hysteresis Loops:\n\nSmall loops = low max \\(H\\), material not saturated.\nBigger loops = higher max \\(H\\), approaching saturation.\nOnce you reach saturation, going further with \\(H\\) doesn’t change \\(B\\) much — hysteresis loop tops out.\n\n\n\n\nNormal Magnetisation curve (ChatGPT explanation)\n\nNormal Magnetisation curve (ChatGPT explanation)\n💡 TL;DR (Answer First)\nThe normal magnetization curve is a smooth curve made by connecting the “tips” (endpoints) of smaller hysteresis loops at increasing max \\(H\\) values. It’s a way to define a unique value of magnetic flux density \\(B\\) for each magnetizing force \\(H\\), by averaging out the behavior shown in hysteresis loops.\n\n📘 What’s Going On?\n\nHysteresis Loops:\n\nWhen you apply a magnetic field \\(H\\) to a material and then reduce it, the magnetic flux density \\(B\\) doesn’t follow the same path back — it lags behind. That’s hysteresis.\nIf you increase \\(H\\) only a little, you get a small loop. Increase it more, you get a bigger loop, approaching saturation.\n\nMany Loops for One Material:\n\nIn Fig. 12.6, they show 3 different hysteresis loops, each with a different maximum \\(H\\) — none reaching full saturation.\nEach loop shows what \\(B\\) does when you ramp \\(H\\) up and down within that max limit.\n\nThe Problem:\n\nSince \\(B\\) depends on the history of \\(H\\), for one value of \\(H\\) you might have many possible values of \\(B\\) (depending on which loop you’re on).\nSo you can’t easily assign a single value of \\(B\\) for each \\(H\\).\n\nThe Solution: The Normal Magnetization Curve:\n\nTo “compromise”, they connect the tips of these loops — the furthest points each loop reaches in the positive \\(H\\) direction.\nThe resulting smooth curve (heavy solid line in Fig. 12.6) traces the progressive magnetization of the material as if you increased \\(H\\) slowly and didn’t let it decrease.\nIt’s like an envelope that wraps the tops of all the loops.\n\n\n\n📊 Why It Matters\nThis normal magnetization curve is useful because:\n\nIt gives a single-valued relationship between \\(B\\) and \\(H\\) (ignoring hysteresis).\nIt’s helpful for modeling or approximating magnetic materials without simulating full hysteresis.\nIt’s often used in magnetic circuit analysis and material characterization.\n\n\n🧠 Visualization Tip\nThink of drawing several mountain-shaped curves (the loops) on a graph, each taller than the last. Then draw a line connecting just the peaks. That’s your normal magnetization curve.",

You might only only need the dropdown\n\n\n\nSpeakers and Microphones (Edits pending)\nElectromagnetic effects are the moving force in the design of speakers such as the one shown in Figure 8. The shape of the pulsating waveform of the input current is determined by the sound to be reproduced by the speaker at a high audio level. As the current peaks and returns to the valleys of the sound pattern, the strength of the electromagnet varies in exactly the same manner. This causes the cone of the speaker to vibrate at a frequency directly proportional to the pulsating input. The higher the pitch of the sound pattern, the higher is the oscillating frequency between the peaks and valleys and the higher is the frequency of vibration of the cone.\n\n\nhow can the cone vibrate? how is the cone affected by the magnetic field?\n\nGreat question — you’re thinking exactly like an engineer should.\n\n✅ Answer:\nThe cone vibrates because the input current creates a changing magnetic field in a coil (electromagnet), which interacts with a permanent magnet to push and pull the coil — and the coil is attached to the cone.\nThis mechanical motion makes the cone vibrate, pushing air, and producing sound.\n\n🧲 How it works, step by step:\n\nCoil + Cone (Voice Coil)\n\n\nThe speaker has a lightweight coil of wire called the voice coil.\nThe coil is attached to the speaker cone.\n\n\nPermanent Magnet\n\n\nThere’s a permanent magnet fixed in place, usually shaped like a ring, creating a constant magnetic field.\n\n\nCurrent = Magnetic Force\n\n\nWhen an audio current flows through the coil, the coil becomes an electromagnet.\nThe Lorentz force acts on the coil:\n\\[\n\\vec{F} = I \\cdot \\vec{L} \\times \\vec{B}\n\\]\nwhere \\(I\\) is the current, \\(\\vec{L}\\) is the wire direction, and \\(\\vec{B}\\) is the magnetic field from the permanent magnet.\n\n\nAlternating Current = Push & Pull\n\n\nSince the audio signal is AC (goes + and –), the direction of current changes constantly.\nThis means the force on the coil pushes and pulls repeatedly.\nThe coil moves back and forth inside the magnetic gap.\n\n\nThe Cone Moves\n\n\nBecause the coil is glued to the cone, the cone moves with it.\nAs the coil vibrates, the cone vibrates, moving air → you hear sound.\n\n\n📊 Why does pitch affect frequency?\n\nHigh pitch = fast vibration = high-frequency AC signal\nThis causes faster oscillation of the current → faster movement of the coil → faster vibration of the cone → higher sound frequency\n\n\n🧠 Analogy\nImagine holding a small drum by its edge and tapping it repeatedly. If you tap slow → low sound. Tap fast → high sound. In a speaker, the magnetic field does the tapping!\n\nLet me know if you’d like a diagram or animation!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Speaker\n\n\n\n\n\nOther sibling sections (In Progress)\n\nHall Effect Sensors (In Progress)",

This results in an induced voltage across each coil.\nTransformer convention the coil to which the source is applied is called the primary, and the coil to which the load is applied is called the secondary.\n\\[e_s = N_s \\dfrac{d\\Phi_m}{dt}\\]\n\n\\(e_s =\\) voltage induced across the secondary\n\\(N_s =\\) Number of turn in the secondary coil\n\\(\\Phi_m =\\) Portion of \\(\\Phi_p\\) that links with the secondary winding\n\nIf all of the flux linking the primary links the secondary, then \\(\\Phi_m = \\Phi_p\\)\n\\[e_s = N_s \\dfrac{d\\Phi_m}{dt}\\]\ncoefficient of coupling \\((k)\\) between two coils:\n\\[k = \\frac{\\Phi_m}{\\Phi_p}\\]\nSince the maximum level of \\(\\Phi_m\\) is \\(\\Phi_p\\), the coefficient of coupling between two coils can never be greater than 1.\n\n\nIron Core Transformer\n\\[E_s = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot N_s f \\Phi_m\\]\nThe transformer has 2 parts:\n\nPrimary (for the input)\nSecondary (for the output)\n\nIt consists of a transfer core and 2 coils.
