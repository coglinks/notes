1. What does "steady-state" mean?

> Thus far we have analyzed the behavior of a series RLC circuit whose source voltage is a fixed frequency steady-state sinusoidal supply.

## Lab 9

1. What does a first-order filter mean?

> Objective:
> 
> To study the frequency response of a first-order low-pass filter, and high-pass filter and to determine the cut-off frequency in each case.

**Ans:**

First order filters are RC filters

2. What does gain (dB) mean?

gain means the amount of output gained from the input waveform.

  what does the following mean:

  - Corner frequency

- Decade in $\mathrm{ Slope = \frac{ -20~dB }{ Decade } }$

Decade is the number of samples for a specific frequency
