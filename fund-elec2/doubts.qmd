1. What does real power mean? How is it different from $Q,~P$ and $S$?
    
    **Ans:** <br>
    Real power stands for the power dissipated by the resistor.

2. Explain:

>Impedance, like resistance or reactance, is not a phasor quantity representing a time-varying function with a particular phase shift. It is simply an operating tool that is extremely useful in determining the magnitude and angle of quantities in a sinusoidal ac network.

3. Are output voltages the same as voltage drops?

4. You call something with a resistance a resistor. What do u call something with an impedance?

## three phase systems

1. In a Delta system: when we have different line voltages, which one should be used for each branch of the delta system?

    **Ans:** <br>
    Have a look at the circuit connections. From which wire to which wire are the 2 points of a branch connected? Look for a line voltage that matches such a configuration.

2. Can resonance occur without resistance?

    **Ans:** <br>
    Theoretically, yes. But practically, no. Resonance circuits are fundamentally studied as RLC circuits

3. Which is correct: $j5~\Omega$ or $5j~\Omega$?

    **Ans:** <br>
    $j5~\Omega$

4. How to solve:

::: {.center}
![q4-a-vs-f.png](doubts-img/q4-a-vs-f.png){#q4-a-vs-f.png width=300}
:::

## Methods of Analysis

### Nodal

1. When is the direction of the current pre-determined? What if the polarity of any component is given? like this capacitor

::: {.center}
![capacitor.png](doubts-img/capacitor.png){#capacitor.png width=300}
:::

or when the polarity of a voltage source is given

**Ans:**

> When a current source with current direction is in one of the branches, then the direction of that branch is of the same direction as the current source

what else?

2. Can a number be $-6\angle 0^\circ$? Because this value in the calculator gives a math error
