## Superposition Theorem

Same as DC, except AC voltage and impedance is used.

Use of AC only changes the calculations and not the theory involved.

# begin: This is to be transfered to the parallel circuit notes

In a simple parallel circuit, if the impedance of the parallel branches are equal, then CDR is applied as:

$$I = \frac{I_S}{\text{No of branches having an equal impedance}}$$

# end

## Thevenin's Theorem


Same as DC, except AC voltage and impedance is used.

Use of AC only changes the calculations and not the theory involved.
